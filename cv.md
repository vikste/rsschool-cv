# Halyna Stepanenko

I enjoy by building things. Itâ€™s the pleasure for me of make things that are useful to other people. Deep within, everyone would like if others were using their work and to find it helpful. Happiness is determined by many indicators. One of them is to be satisfied with your work and its results. And there is already great success - a clear understanding of the goals and a step-by-step plan of action towards them. I believe each of the projects is unique and should be treated as your own business. Don't stop, learn and run faster than others.
I have my potential, passion and ability to learn fast. I don't think that everybody is going to teach me when i come to the workplace . Rather being a Junior means always learning new things from everywhere.
